## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Laptop. You will need a laptop with administrator access. Using a remote service will be possible but not as
convenient.  It should be able to run a recent updated version of the operating system, support the latest
version of Docker, with 8 GB of RAM 512 GB SSD disk space, and 4 cores should be sufficient.
* Docker.  Podman is an open source alternative, but it is not as good.
* Github pro user account.  Students can have pro features by registering here: https://education.github.com/pack
* Lastpass.  You will need a way to manage secrets securely.  While the free version should be adeduate, you should
pay them so there is a simple exchange as to why they want to keep your passwords secure.
* ChatGPT pro.  There is no comparable tool and the pro version is substantially better than the free version.
